#Undirected Graph and Directed Graph
#Node/Vertex
#Directed Edge
#Cycles in Graph: Starting from a node and ending at same node
#Directed Cyclic graph and Directed Acyclic Graph
#Path: Contanins nodes where all the nodes are reachable
#Degree: No. of edges connected to a particular node
#Total Degree= 2*Edges
#Indgree: Towards that node, Outdegree: Away from that node
