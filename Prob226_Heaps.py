#Complete BT: All elements have 2 childrens except the last level
#Almost Complete BT: All elements have 2 children except the last and second last level all leaf node should start from extreme left
#A max heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the "max heap property." It's a type of binary heap where the main rule is that for any given node, its value must be greater than or equal to the values of its children.
#A min heap: The main rule here is that for any given node, its value must be less than or equal to the values of its children.
#Left Index: 2*index+1 and Right Index: 2*index+2 (For converting it into array/list)
#Parent= LIF(index/2)-1
#No. of Internal nodes= Leaf Nodes-1 (For Complete BT)
#Index of Leaf node in almost complete BT: n/2 to n-1
#Index of Internal node in almost complete BT: 0 to n/2 -1
